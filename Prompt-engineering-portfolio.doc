📌 Assignment 5 – Target Audiences for Bank Savings Account

🎯 Prompt:
As a bank marketer create a 3 profitable target audience for a bank savings account
• Represent point in bulletin
• No summary and conclusions
• 200-words
• Friendly and simple tone

🤖 AI Response:

University Students (Ages 18–25)
Students may not earn much now, but they’re always saving for small goals: school projects, phone upgrades, travel, or “emergency jollof.” Catching them young builds lifelong loyalty, especially when the account comes with free mobile banking and discounts on school items. A savings culture now = a solid customer in 5 years.

Small Business Owners & Side Hustlers
From fashion vendors to POS agents and food delivery folks — Nigeria’s informal sector is booming. Many just need a safe space to drop daily earnings and withdraw later. A well-marketed savings account with zero maintenance fees and quick loan access will easily win this group. Add mobile alerts and they’re sold.

Young Parents (Ages 28–40)
This group thinks long-term: school fees, rent, and family emergencies. A savings account tailored for family planning or even child education savings will speak their language. A joint savings option with spouse access or goal-based features makes it both emotional and practical.


🧑‍🏫 Mentor Score: 25/25
✅ Friendly, professional, practical. Nigerian context well addressed. Commercial-ready.
